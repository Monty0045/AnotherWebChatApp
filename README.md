Hackathon submission for Sunhacks virtual fall 2020 hackaton.

This project is a chatroom web app where you join a global chatroom and are assigned a random username during your time connected.
Anyone is able to read messages sent by anyone and anyone is able to send a message to everyone. So quiet hectic.

This was mostly an excuse to play around with react and node.js, something both me and my partner wanted to learn.

In order to run you need to use npm. If this is your first time running you'll need to install some dependencies; in the client directory 
run 'npm install' in terminal. In the backend directory run 'npm install express'. Now all needed dependencies should be working. 
In order to execute: in the client directory run 'npm start' and in the backend run 'node index.js'
